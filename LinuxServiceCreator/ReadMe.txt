It automates the process of making a service that starts on launch, to stop it I'd assume you just delete the service from this folder /home/username/.config/systemd/user/ but I don't know and can't be bothered figureing it out

This has to be run from the Terminal, I couldn't figure out how to make it open via the Terminal automatically
