Just some simple Linux programs, maybe one day I'll uplaod something crazy 

I make these for Bazzite at the moment, Bazzite is KDE based (I don't really know what that means by the way), I have no idea if any of them will work on other versions like Ubuntu or Debian or whatever else, but so far these are mostly just automating processes done with simple bash programming and Terminal commands, so it'll work on whatever has the same commands, if it doesn't probably ask an AI to write it so it works on something else
